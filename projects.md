# Projects

Here are some of my favorite projects from this past semester: (All Fall 2025)

| Project | Description | Map
|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Population Density in Miami per Block (in part)| A visualization of the population density in Miami per block. Creating this map was interesting as I had previously input data to analyzet Miami on a citywide level by U.S. Census Tract, but now needed to determine the most effective way to visualize that on a local block level. I changed the color design convention to make it more clear and visually appealing when at the block level. Thinking through this map made me also consider how best to display busier maps with lots of small divisons of data, but to me it was a true representation of "data is beautiful". This also made me consider which local block level to chose to display for the snapshot for this map. In order to calculate the population density to create this map, I also learned how to create and calculate in a new field with population data and a calculated geometry for each block. | ![Population Density in Miami per Block (in part)](<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/seanmurphy334/seanmurphy334/main/BlockPopDenMiami.png" width="500">)
| 2020 Election Results in PA | A county-level vote percentage visualization of the 2020 Presidential Election Visualizing election results is something that I've been familiar with by following a group of creators on Twitter over the past few years. I've seen many of these simple maps created and shared and thought that is was an effective way to visualize data, however I had no idea how to do it myself. Creating a county-level map of Pennsylvania's 2020 Presidential Election results was a formative moment for me to realize how simple it was and that I could do it myself. This map was extremely helpful for me to understand the visual hierarchy in practice and to perfect the design philosophy behind the color gradients used. I took those methods we learned in design and applied them, while learning the best way to create six gradient levels to sort out the data effectively. | ![PA 2020 Election Results by County](https://github.com/seanmurphy334/seanmurphy334/blob/main/PA2020Election.png)
| Homicide Density per Square Mile in Chicago, by Police District | A dot proportional symbol visualization of the homicide density per square mile in Chicago by police district. This map required several steps to take Chicago crime data and Chicago Police Districts and match them to each other. This allowed me to view the number of homicides along with AirBnB review data and average AirBnB price data by police district todetermine if homicides impacts tourism in the city. This is one of several maps that I created as part of this assignment, including others which included the AirBnB data. This map was particularly interesting as it took several different data sources and linked them together to determine an actual outcome to help inform policy at the city level. This type of visualization is very effective and can be compelling for both policymakers and the public at large. I learned specifically how to join tables that hold similar data and share a common variable and how those tables can then be combined to show data on a map. I also learned how to calculate density within a region with that data. | ![Homicide Density per Square Mile in Chicago by Police District](https://github.com/seanmurphy334/seanmurphy334/blob/main/Lab4Homicides.png)
