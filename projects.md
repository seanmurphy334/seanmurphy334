# Projects

Here are some of my favorite projects from this past semester: (All Fall 2025)

| Project | Description |
|------|----------|--------------|
| Population Density in Miami per Block (in part)| A visualization of the population density in Miami per block. Creating this map was interesting as I had previously input data to analyzet Miami on a citywide level by U.S. Census Tract, but now needed to determine the most effective way to visualize that on a local block level. I changed the color design convention to make it more clear and visually appealing when at the block level. Thinking through this map made me also consider how best to display "busier" maps with lots of small divisons of data. This also made me consider which local block level to chose to display for the snapshot for this map. In order to calculate the population density to create this map, I also learned how to create and calculate in a new field with population data and a calculated geometry for each block. | ![Population Density in Miami per Block (in part)](https://github.com/seanmurphy334/seanmurphy334/blob/main/BlockPopDenMiami.png)
| 2020 Election Results in PA | A county-level vote percentage visualization of the 2020 Presidential Election Visualizing election results is something that I've been familiar with by following a group of creators on Twitter over the past few years. I've seen many of these simple maps created and shared and thought that is was an effective way to visualize data, however I had no idea how to do it myself. Creating a county-level map of Pennsylvania's 2020 Presidential Election results was a formative moment for me to realize how simple it was and that I could do it myself. This map was extremely helpful for me to understand the visual hierarchy in practice and to perfect the design philosophy behind the color gradients used. I took those methods we learned in design and applied them, while learning the best way to create six gradient levels to sort out the data effectively. | ![PA 2020 Election Results by County](https://github.com/seanmurphy334/seanmurphy334/blob/main/PA2020Election.png)
| Hispanic Population in the Contiguous U.S. by State | A dot-density visualization of the Hispanic population in the contigious U.S. by state |
| Los Angeles Supervisorial Districts Containing Low-Income Schools Near Landfills | A visualization of LA County Supervisorial Districts and schools below 50% of income per capita within 0.5 KM of a methane-producing landfill |
| Wealthiest Census Tract to contain a Methane-Producing Landfill in LA County | A visualization of LA Census Tracts and the wealthiest tract containing a methane-producing landfill |
